## 1. Project Overview

QDArchive is a web service for researchers to publish and archive qualitative data, with an emphasis on Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) files. The goal of Part 1 is to **seed QDArchive** by building an automated data acquisition pipeline that:

- Scrapes qualitative research projects from assigned public repositories
- Downloads all publicly available files
- Stores structured metadata in a SQLite database following the professor's exact schema
- Exports all data to CSV format
- Reports clearly on what was downloaded and what could not be downloaded (with reasons)

| `crawl_all_datafirst.py` | ~45–60 minutes (596 studies) |
| `harvard_dataverse_scraper.py` | ~20–30 minutes |

---

## 7. Scraping Strategy

### Two Approaches Used (as per professor's guidelines)

**Approach 1 — Query-based search (original default)**
Used for `main.py` with DataFirst. Searches using specific queries (`interview`, `qualitative`, `qdpx`, etc.) via the NADA JSON API.

**Approach 2 — Full catalog crawl**
Used for `crawl_all_datafirst.py`. Fetches all studies from DataFirst with no keyword filter, using pagination (`ps=100&page=N`). This captured all 596 studies including those not matching keyword queries.

**Approach 3 — API-based scraping**
Used for `harvard_dataverse_scraper.py`. Uses the Harvard Dataverse public REST API (`/api/search` and `/api/datasets/:persistentId/versions/:version/files`) to collect datasets and download public files.

---

## 8. Search Queries Used

### DataFirst UCT

| Query | Studies Found |
|-------|--------------|
| `interview` | 301 |
| `qualitative` | 28 |
| `qdpx` | 0 |
| `transcript` | 3 |
| `focus group` | 28 |
| *(full catalog crawl — no query)* | 596 total |

### Harvard Dataverse (Murray Archive)

| Query | Subtree |
|-------|---------|
| `interview` | `mra` (Murray Research Archive) |
| `qualitative` | `mra` |
| `longitudinal` | `mra` |
| `oral history` | `mra` |
| `life study` | `mra` |
| `survey` | `mra` |
| `qdpx qualitative` | `harvard` (broader) |
| `interview transcript qualitative data` | `harvard` (broader) |

---

## 9. Download Strategy

### DataFirst UCT

DataFirst uses NADA/IHSN platform software. Two layers of data are accessible:

**Layer 1 — Metadata (free, via JSON API)**
All 596 studies have metadata freely accessible via `GET /api/catalog/{idno}`. This includes title, description, authors, language, DOI, upload date, and access conditions.

**Layer 2 — Related Materials (free, via HTML scraping)**
Each study has a `/related-materials` page containing downloadable PDFs, Excel files, and ZIP archives. These include:
- Survey questionnaires
- Statistical release reports
- Metadata documentation
- Codebooks
- Program files

These were discovered by scraping the HTML page and downloading each linked file.

**Layer 3 — Microdata (login required)**
The actual SPSS/Stata microdata files require institutional registration at DataFirst. These are correctly recorded as `FAILED_LOGIN_REQUIRED`.

### Harvard Murray Archive / Harvard Dataverse

The Harvard Murray Archive website (`murray.harvard.edu`) is a landing page only. The actual datasets are hosted on Harvard Dataverse at `dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/mra`.

**Harvard Dataverse Public API** (no login required):
- `GET /api/search?q={query}&subtree=mra&type=dataset` — search datasets
- `GET /api/datasets/:persistentId/versions/:version/files` — list files
- `GET /api/access/datafile/{id}` — download individual files

Public (unrestricted) files are downloaded directly. Restricted files are recorded as `FAILED_LOGIN_REQUIRED`.

---

## 10. Data Quality Notes

The professor's stated rule: *"Do not change data when downloading; data quality issues will be resolved in a second step."*

### Issue 1: Keywords Missing for DataFirst Studies
DataFirst's NADA API does not include keyword fields in their JSON metadata responses for the majority of studies. The `KEYWORDS` table is populated only for Harvard Dataverse datasets where keywords were available in the API response. This is a source repository data quality issue.

### Issue 2: Harvard Murray Website Has Minimal Content
The `murray.harvard.edu` website is an institutional landing page with only ~9 navigable pages. All actual research data is on Harvard Dataverse. The HTML scraper correctly handles this and the Dataverse API scraper was added to collect proper data.

### Issue 3: Duplicate File Entries (Fixed)
Some DataFirst related-materials pages listed the same file multiple times under different sections. A deduplication query was applied after scraping:
```sql
DELETE FROM FILES WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) FROM FILES
    GROUP BY project_id, file_name, file_type
);
```
1,318 duplicates were removed.

### Issue 4: Version Folder NULL
The `download_version_folder` field is NULL for all records. DataFirst encodes version in the `idno` string (e.g. `v1` in `zaf-statssa-dts-2021-v1`). Harvard Dataverse uses versioned dataset DOIs. Extracting explicit version subfolders is a data quality improvement for a future step.

### Issue 5: Status Enum Normalization
The initial scraper used `SUCCESS` instead of `SUCCEEDED`. All records were normalized to `SUCCEEDED` to match the professor's DOWNLOAD_RESULT enum.

### Issue 6: License Values
DataFirst states "Creative Commons CC-BY (Attribution-only) License" in access conditions — stored as `CC BY`. Harvard Dataverse datasets use `CC0` by default — stored as `CC0` where detected.

---

## 11. Technical Challenges

### Challenge 1: DataFirst API Returns HTTP 400 for All Numeric IDs

**Problem:** The initial scraper called `/api/catalog/193`, `/api/catalog/231` etc. using numeric IDs — every single one returned HTTP 400 Bad Request.

**Root cause:** DataFirst's NADA API uses string `idno` identifiers (e.g. `zaf-statssa-dts-2021-v1`), not numeric database IDs. The numeric IDs visible in URLs are internal only.

**Solution:** Updated the scraper to extract the `idno` string field from the catalog list response and use that for all subsequent API calls. Result: 313 → 596 studies successfully processed.

---

### Challenge 2: Free Downloads Hidden Behind HTML Page

**Problem:** First version of scraper reported `FAILED_NO_DOWNLOAD_LINK` for all 313 DataFirst studies because the JSON API `/resources` endpoint returned empty arrays.

**Root cause:** DataFirst separates microdata (login-required, in the API) from related materials (free PDFs, accessible only via HTML at `/related-materials`). The API does not expose the free files.

**Solution:** Added a secondary BeautifulSoup HTML scraper that visits each study's `/related-materials` HTML page, finds all `/download/` links, and downloads them. This resulted in 1,307 successfully downloaded files.

---

### Challenge 3: Harvard Murray Website Is Just a Landing Page

**Problem:** The Harvard Murray scraper found only 9 pages and downloaded only 1 file, despite the Murray Archive containing "over 100 terabytes of data."

**Root cause:** `www.murray.harvard.edu` is an institutional landing page. All actual datasets are stored on Harvard Dataverse at `dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/mra`, which is a completely separate URL.

**Solution:** Wrote a new `harvard_dataverse_scraper.py` that uses the Harvard Dataverse public REST API to search the `mra` subtree, retrieve dataset metadata, list files, and download public files. This increased Harvard projects from 9 to 922.

---

### Challenge 4: Mixed Status Values in Database

**Problem:** Two different status values existed in the FILES table — `SUCCESS` (from old scraper) and `SUCCEEDED` (from new scraper) — both meaning the same thing.

**Root cause:** The initial scraper used `SUCCESS` before the professor's enum was confirmed. The updated scraper correctly used `SUCCEEDED`.

**Solution:** Applied a normalization query after all scraping was complete:
```python
conn.execute("UPDATE FILES SET status='SUCCEEDED' WHERE status='SUCCESS'")
```
Result: 9,989 unified `SUCCEEDED` records.

---

### Challenge 5: Git Refusing to Commit the Database File

**Problem:** Running `git add 23079506-seeding.db` produced no error but the file was not staged, because `*.db` was in `.gitignore`.

**Root cause:** The `.gitignore` file contained `*.db` to prevent the working `metadata.db` from being committed. This also blocked the submission database.

**Solution:** Two-step fix:
1. Added `!23079506-seeding.db` to `.gitignore` to whitelist the specific file
2. Used `git add -f 23079506-seeding.db` to force-add it

---

### Challenge 6: Python SSL Warning on macOS

**Problem:** Every run displayed:
```
NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+,
currently the 'ssl' module is compiled with 'LibreSSL 2.8.3'
```

**Root cause:** macOS ships with LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL. urllib3 v2 prefers OpenSSL but works with LibreSSL.

**Solution:** This warning is harmless — all downloads complete successfully. Suppressed in production by filtering warnings; no code changes required.

---

### Challenge 7: DataFirst API Uses idno String in URL, Not Numeric ID

**Problem:** When checking the catalog API response, studies return a numeric `id` (e.g. `940`) AND a string `idno` (e.g. `zaf-statssa-dts-2021-v1`). The related-materials HTML page uses the numeric ID in its URL (`/catalog/940/related-materials`) but the detail API uses the string idno.

**Root cause:** NADA software has two separate identifier systems — an internal database integer ID and a public string identifier.

**Solution:** The scraper extracts both: uses `idno` for API calls and `id` (numeric) for HTML page scraping.

---

### Challenge 8: Harvard Dataverse Restricted Files

**Problem:** 11,198 files on Harvard Dataverse returned HTTP 403 or were flagged as `restricted: true` in the API response.

**Root cause:** Murray Archive datasets require an application form and approval process. Restricted files cannot be downloaded without an account and approved access request.

**Solution:** The scraper checks the `restricted` field in the API file metadata before attempting download. Restricted files are immediately recorded as `FAILED_LOGIN_REQUIRED` without wasting a download attempt.
