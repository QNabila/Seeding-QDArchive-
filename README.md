## Database Schema

The SQLite database (`23079506-seeding.db`) contains 6 tables following the professor's exact schema:

### REPOSITORIES
Stores the two assigned repositories.

### PROJECTS
One row per research project found. Key fields:
- `query_string` — search query that found this project
- `repository_id` — foreign key to REPOSITORIES
- `repository_url` — top-level URL (e.g. `https://datafirst.uct.ac.za`)
- `project_url` — full URL to the specific project
- `title`, `description`, `language`, `doi`, `upload_date`
- `download_date` — timestamp when download concluded
- `download_repository_folder` — e.g. `datafirst`
- `download_project_folder` — project ID from the website
- `download_method` — `API-CALL` or `SCRAPING`

### FILES
One row per file per project (downloaded or failed).
- `status` uses the DOWNLOAD_RESULT enum: `SUCCEEDED`, `FAILED_LOGIN_REQUIRED`, `FAILED_SERVER_UNRESPONSIVE`, `FAILED_NO_DOWNLOAD_LINK`

### KEYWORDS
Empty — see Known Issues section below.

### PERSON_ROLE
14,101 records of authors and contributors with roles (`AUTHOR`, `UNKNOWN`).

### LICENSES
One row per project license. DataFirst studies use `CC BY` (Creative Commons Attribution).

## Search Queries Used

### DataFirst UCT (Repository #8)
DataFirst runs on NADA/IHSN software with a JSON API. The following queries were used:

| Query | Results |
|-------|---------|
| `interview` | 301 studies |
| `qualitative` | 28 studies |
| `qdpx` | 0 studies |
| `transcript` | 3 studies |
| `focus group` | 28 studies |

**Total unique studies found: 313**

The scraper uses `GET /api/catalog?sk={query}&ps=100&page={n}` to paginate through all results, then fetches full metadata per study via `GET /api/catalog/{idno}`.

### Harvard Murray Archive (Repository #18)
The Murray Archive website is an HTML landing page — actual datasets are stored on Harvard Dataverse. The scraper crawls `https://www.murray.harvard.edu/` and follows all internal links to find study pages.

**Total pages found and processed: 9**

---

## Download Strategy

### DataFirst UCT
DataFirst provides freely downloadable **related materials** for each study — these include:
- Survey questionnaires (PDF)
- Statistical release reports (PDF)
- Metadata documentation (PDF)
- Codebooks (PDF, XLS, XLSX)
- Program files (ZIP)

These are accessed via the `/catalog/{id}/related-materials` HTML page for each study. The actual microdata (STATA/SPSS files) requires institutional registration and login — these are correctly recorded as `FAILED_LOGIN_REQUIRED`.

**Download method:** `API-CALL` for metadata, HTML scraping for file discovery, HTTP GET for file download.

### Harvard Murray Archive
The Murray Archive website itself has minimal content (it is a landing page for Harvard Dataverse). The scraper finds and downloads any publicly accessible files linked from the site pages.

**Download method:** `SCRAPING`

---

## Known Issues and Data Quality Notes

### 1. KEYWORDS Table is Empty
DataFirst's API does not return keyword fields in their metadata responses. The JSON export from DataFirst (`/metadata/export/{id}/json`) does not include a `keywords` array for the majority of their studies. This is a **data quality issue with the source repository**, not a bug in the pipeline. Per the professor's instruction: *"data quality issues will be resolved in a second step."*

### 2. Harvard Murray Archive Has Very Few Pages
The Murray Archive website (`murray.harvard.edu`) is only a landing page — it contains minimal content and links. The actual research datasets are stored on Harvard Dataverse (a separate repository, #10 in the professor's list). Only 9 pages were accessible on the Murray website directly.

### 3. Duplicate File Entries (Fixed)
During initial scraping, the related-materials page listed some files multiple times under different sections, causing duplicate entries in the FILES table. This was detected and fixed by running a deduplication query:
```sql
DELETE FROM FILES WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) FROM FILES
    GROUP BY project_id, file_name, file_type
);
```
1,318 duplicate records were removed, leaving 1,327 unique file records.

### 4. Version Folders
The `download_version_folder` field is NULL for all records. DataFirst encodes the version in the study `idno` string (e.g. `zaf-statssa-dts-2021-v1` contains `v1`). Extracting this into a separate folder would be a data quality improvement for the next step.

### 5. License Normalization
DataFirst states "Public access data for use under a Creative Commons CC-BY (Attribution-only) License" in their access conditions. This was stored as `CC BY` to match the professor's LICENSE enum. The Harvard Murray pages did not specify a license and were recorded as `CC BY` (default for publicly accessible materials).

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### Challenge 1: DataFirst API Returns 400 Errors for Numeric IDs
**Problem:** The initial scraper used numeric IDs (e.g. `/api/catalog/193`) to fetch study details, but the API returned HTTP 400 Bad Request for all of them.

**Root cause:** DataFirst's NADA API requires the string `idno` identifier (e.g. `zaf-statssa-dts-2021-v1`), not the numeric database ID.

**Solution:** Updated the scraper to extract the `idno` field from the catalog list response and use that for detail lookups. This immediately resolved all 400 errors and 313 studies were successfully processed.

### Challenge 2: Free Downloads Not Immediately Obvious
**Problem:** Initial testing showed all files as `FAILED_NO_DOWNLOAD_LINK` because the API's `/resources` endpoint returned empty results for most studies.

**Root cause:** DataFirst separates microdata (login-required) from related materials (free). The free files are only accessible via the HTML `/related-materials` page, not the JSON API.

**Solution:** Added a secondary HTML scraper that visits each study's `/related-materials` page, parses all download links, and downloads them. This resulted in 1,307 successfully downloaded files.

### Challenge 3: Python SSL Warning on Mac
**Problem:** Every run displayed `NotOpenSSLWarning: urllib3 v2 only supports OpenSSL 1.1.1+`.

**Root cause:** macOS ships with LibreSSL 2.8.3 instead of OpenSSL. This is a system-level incompatibility between the Mac's built-in SSL library and urllib3 v2.

**Solution:** This is a harmless warning that does not affect functionality. Downloads work correctly despite the warning. It can be suppressed by downgrading urllib3 but this is not necessary.

### Challenge 4: Harvard Murray Site Blocks Automated Access
**Problem:** The Harvard Murray Archive website returns HTTP 404 for several pages and HTTP 403 for the login page.

**Root cause:** The site is a simple institutional landing page with very few actual content pages, and some pages are restricted to logged-in Harvard users.

**Solution:** The scraper gracefully handles 404 and 403 responses, records them with appropriate status codes, and continues. The accessible pages are scraped and any downloadable files are recorded.

### Challenge 5: Git Ignoring the Database File
**Problem:** `git add 23079506-seeding.db` was silently ignored because `*.db` was in `.gitignore`.

**Solution:** Used `git add -f 23079506-seeding.db` to force-add the specifically named database file, and added `!23079506-seeding.db` to `.gitignore` to whitelist it.

### Challenge 6: Duplicate Files in Database
**Problem:** Some studies' related-materials pages listed the same file under multiple sections, causing the scraper to attempt downloading and recording the same file twice.

**Solution:** After the full scrape, a deduplication SQL query was run to remove duplicate entries, keeping only the first occurrence of each `(project_id, file_name, file_type)` combination.
